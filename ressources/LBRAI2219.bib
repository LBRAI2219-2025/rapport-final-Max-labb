	abstract = {Societal Impact Statement Intercropping techniques like the Three Sisters, where maize, beans, and squash are grown in an intermixed arrangement, have sustained communities in the Americas for thousands of years and continue to be practiced around the world. In collaboration with the Catawba Indian Nation, we assessed the yield and labor demands required when farming with Three Sisters versus monoculture arrangements. Our results illustrate how farmers could use different planting strategies depending on their priorities (e.g., maximizing yield) and available resources (e.g., conserving land, seeds, or labor). Studies like these can help inform food sovereignty programs and support cultural initiatives in Native communities. Summary Many Native American communities have historically grown maize, beans, and squash in polyculture as the Three Sisters because of the reciprocal ecological benefits the species provide each other and the surrounding environment. For instance, archaeological remains indicate that the Catawba Indian Nation had grown the Three Sisters for hundreds of years before experiencing the expansion of the colonial market economy, a smallpox epidemic, and the drastic loss of land. To support the Catawba Indian Nation's food sovereignty and traditional ecological knowledge initiatives, we assess the yield and labor demands of growing their traditional variety of maize, beans, and squash plants in the Three Sisters planting design versus in monoculture conditions. While total maize yield was equivalent in monoculture and the Three Sisters, plants grew larger, had higher survival, and produced greater yield per plant and per unit area of land in the Three Sisters. [Correction added on 21 November 2024, after first online publication: The preceding sentence has been corrected.] Squash yield was highest in monoculture. Trellising bean plants in monoculture required the most labor, and altogether, yield per hour of labor was higher in monoculture than in the Three Sisters. Ultimately, the most appropriate farming strategy for the Catawba Indian Nation to use will depend on their priorities (e.g., maximizing the production of one species versus all species). We discuss the challenges managers of small farms face when considering traditional versus modern agricultural methods and describe how a respectful partnership between the Catawba Nation and Davidson College expanded and enhanced the outcomes of this study.},

The most widespread implementation, intercropping with the legume Desmodium, reduces herbivory damage from the invasive fall armyworm (FAW) Spodoptera frugiperda. However, the three publications to date investigating underlying mechanisms disagree whether the Desmodium intercrop emits bioactive volatiles that repel FAW. We aimed to resolve this controversy by measuring volatile emission from Desmodium intortum (greenleaf Desmodium) and D. incanum intercrops in push-pull fields, and assaying their effects on the behavior of the FAW in oviposition and wind tunnel choice bioassays. We detected many volatile substances in the headspaces of both Desmodium species, which exhibited similar profiles, including substances previously reported to repel lepidopteran herbivores. FAW moths preferred to oviposit on maize over Desmodium, but not on maize further from versus closer to Desmodium plants that were inaccessible to the moths, but sharing the air. In a wind tunnel bioassay, the moths tended to prefer maize volatiles over a combination of volatiles from maize and D. intortum, but not D. incanum. In conclusion, we found D. intortum and D. incanum to emit volatiles that have been shown to be bioactive, and FAW moths to prefer maize over either Desmodium species. Moreover, additional mechanisms are likely important for reducing FAW damage to maize under push-pull cultivation.},

	abstract = {Intercropping with maize (Zea mays L.) and common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) is one of the widely used practices of producing food crops on smallholder farms in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). However, the knowledge on the options toward intensification of available practices in order to optimize systems productivity using intercrops is generally lacking. Therefore, this study evaluated the effects of intercropping, cropping seasons, and different varieties of common bean on productivity of the maize-common bean based intercrop through 5 cropping seasons from 2015 to 2017. Experimental site is located at 03¬∞18 ‚Ä≤03.74‚Ä≤' S and 37¬∞12‚Ä≤13.94‚Ä≤ E and an altitude of 956‚ÄØm above sea level in the northern highlands of Tanzania. Hybrid maize Dekalb brand (DK 8031) and two varieties of common bean (improved Lyamungu 90 and local Mkanamna) were used. The treatments within a replicate were: (1) sole crops: (i) maize, (ii) local bean, (iii) improved bean, and (2) intercrops: (i) maize‚ÄØ+‚ÄØlocal bean, (ii) maize‚ÄØ+‚ÄØimproved bean. Interaction and individual effects of cropping seasons (S) (periods of years ‚Äì short and long rains), varieties of common bean (V), and cropping systems (C) (sole and intercrop) were studied. Results indicated that S‚ÄØ√ó‚ÄØV interaction was significant on bean grain yield and 100-seed weight. Improved bean outweighed the local bean with grain yields ranging from 2.2‚Äì3.5‚ÄØt ha-1 and 0.2‚Äì2.5‚ÄØt ha-1, respectively. The effect of S was significant on all measured variables in beans and the effect of M was only significant on total biomass. Further, S significantly affected all measured variables in maize and grain yields ranged from 2.3‚Äì2.6‚ÄØt ha-1. In maize, correlations were strong (r‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ0.48*; P‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ0.0325) between maize grain yield and ground coverage of leaf canopy measured 42‚Äì56 days after sowing. The land equivalent ratios (LERs) for maize intercropped with improved and local beans were 1.48 and 1.55, respectively but LER values did not differ significantly between bean varieties. In this study, both common bean varieties were sown simultaneously with the maize, which might have resulted in their differential performance. It is recommended that studies are conducted to evaluate time of introducing this legume crop to a maize system such as early sowing, sowing mid in the season after a maize crop is well established, and sowing late in the season when the leaves in maize plant have started to senesce.},

	abstract = {APSIM (Agricultural Production Systems Simulator) is a software system which allows (a) models of crop and pasture production, residue decomposition, soil water and nutrient flow, and erosion to be readily re-configured to simulate various production systems and (b) soil and crop management to be dynamically simulated using conditional rules. A key innovation is change from a core concept of a crop responding to resource supplies to that of a soil responding to weather, management and crops. While this achieves a sound logical structure for improved simulation of soil management and long-term change in the soil resource, it does so without loss of sensitivity in simulating crop yields. This concept is implemented using a program structure in which all modules (e.g. growth of specific crops, soil water, soil N, erosion) communicate with each other only by messages passed via a central ‚Äòengine‚Äô. Using a standard interface design, this design enables easy removal, replacement, or exchange of modules without disruption to the operation of the system. Simulation of crop sequences and multiple crops are achieved by managing connection of crop growth modules to the engine. A shell of software tools has been developed within a WINDOWS environment which includes user-installed editor, linker, compiler, testbed generator, graphics, database and version control software. While the engine and modules are coded in FORTRAN, the Shell is in C++. The resulting product is one in which the functions are coded in the language most familiar to the developers of scientific modules but provides many of the features of object oriented programming. The Shell is written to be aware of UNIX operating systems and be capable of using the processor on UNIX workstations.},

Herein, we investigated the process of microbial community assembly in maize, peanuts, and shared rhizosphere soil as well as their regulatory mechanisms on root exudates under different planting patterns by combining metabolomic and metagenomic analyses. The results showed that the yield of intercropped maize increased significantly by 21.05\% (2020) and 52.81\% (2021), while the yield of intercropped peanut significantly decreased by 39.51\% (2020) and 32.58\% (2021). The nitrogen accumulation was significantly higher in the roots of the intercropped maize than in those of sole maize at 120 days after sowing, it increased by 129.16\% (2020) and 151.93\% (2021), respectively. The stems and leaves of intercropped peanut significantly decreased by 5.13 and 22.23\% (2020) and 14.45 and 24.54\% (2021), respectively. The root interaction had a significant effect on the content of ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N) as well as the activities of urease (UE), nitrate reductase (NR), protease (Pro), and dehydrogenase (DHO) in the rhizosphere soil. A combined network analysis showed that the content of NH4+-N as well as the enzyme activities of UE, NR and Pro increased in the rhizosphere soil, resulting in cyanidin 3-sambubioside 5-glucoside and cyanidin 3-O-(6-Op-coumaroyl) glucoside-5-O-glucoside; shisonin were significantly up-regulated in the shared soil of intercropped maize and peanut, reshaped the bacterial community composition, and increased the relative abundance of Bradyrhizobium. These results indicate that interspecific root interactions improved the soil microenvironment, regulated the absorption and utilization of nitrogen nutrients, and provided a theoretical basis for high yield and sustainable development in the intercropping of maize and peanut.},

It remains unclear whether and to what extent the benefits of intercropping on crop yield and land-use efficiency vary between the two regions. This meta-analysis compared the performance of intercropping maize with six annual grain legumes (soybean, common bean, groundnut, cowpea, pea, and faba bean) commonly grown in China and Africa. Data extracted from 73 publications were used to analyze land equivalent ratio (LER), yield gain, nitrogen, and phosphorus fertilizer equivalent ratio. The overall values of LER, nitrogen, and phosphorus fertilizer equivalent ratio were significantly {\textgreater}1 for both China and Africa. The overall yield gain was 1.45 ¬± 0.07 t ha‚àí1, with China having a higher mean (2.3 ¬± 0.13 t ha‚àí1) than Africa (0.90 ¬± 0.07 t ha‚àí1). Relay-strip intercropping had the highest LER and yield gain in China, while Africa‚Äôs yield gain was lower in both strip and alternate row intercropping compared with that of China. Maize/common bean intercrop had the highest yield gain in Africa, while maize/faba bean produced high yield gain in China. The yield gain for maize/peanut and maize/soybean was higher in China than in Africa. Increasing nitrogen and phosphorus rates reduced LER in both regions. Here, we show for the first time that while additional phosphorus increases yield gain for Africa it can reduce absolute yields in China. Therefore, the African farmers are recommended to adopt strip or relay-strip intercropping, common bean insertion into intercropping or moderate phosphorus fertilizer application to substantially improve yield gain and income. For China, minimizing fertilizer use by including intercropping with more legume diversity may contribute to reduced environmental problems while achieving high yield gain.},

Although the value is available for some C3 legumes, no value has been determined for common beans within the semi-arid tropics. The coefficient is useful in modelling crop water use as it has been found to be conservative over a range of climates when differences in vapour pressure deficits are accounted for. The objective of the experiment was to determine the transpiration efficiency coefficient for common beans for use in modelling within the semi-arid region of South Africa. Common bean (Phaseoulus vulgaris L.) was grown on a weighing lysimeter during the 2000/2001 and 2001/2002 seasons. Transpiration was measured on hourly basis using the weighing lysimeter and the data integrated over the growing season to determine the seasonal transpiration for the crop. At the same time hourly measurement of canopy vapour pressure deficit was made using wet and dry bulb resistance thermometers housed in mini-shelters at 200‚Äì400mm height. Wet and dry bulb temperature data was also collected at the nearby standard automatic weather station and used to normalize the transpiration efficiency. Transpiration efficiency for the common bean was 1.33 and 1.93gkg‚àí1 which when normalized and root adjusted, gave a transpiration efficiency coefficient of 3.02 and 3.51gkPakg‚àí1 for the 2000/2001 and 2001/2002 seasons respectively. A mean transpiration efficiency coefficient of 3.26¬±0.25gkPakg‚àí1 was adopted for the two seasons. This value is fairly consistent with those obtained for other C3 legumes species, confirming the conservativeness of the coefficient and therefore its usefulness as modelling parameter.},

The different methods are applied to a simplified crop model derived from the STICS model, using simulated data. The criteria for comparison are prediction error and errors in the parameter estimates. Among the methods of model comparison a version of the Schwarz criterion, corrected for small samples and with maximum and minimum bounds for each parameter, is the preferred method. Ridge regression is found to be superior to this best method of model selection.},

	abstract = {Greater understanding of how soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] yield compensation occurs across plant populations would aid research aimed at reducing optimal plant population. Objectives were to determine how net assimilation rate (NAR) and leaf area index (LAI) contribute to crop growth rate (CGR) equilibration across low, medium, and high plant populations during the vegetative (emergence‚ÄìR1) and early reproductive periods (R1‚ÄìR5). Determinate cultivar Delta Pine 3606 (Maturity Group VI) was planted at an optimal planting date during 1995 and 1996 at low (80000 plants ha‚àí1), medium (145000 plants ha‚àí1), and high (390000 plants ha‚àí1) plant populations on a Commerce silt loam near Baton Rouge, LA (30¬∞N). Yield was unaffected by plant population. Equilibration of CGR for low vs. higher plant populations near R1 was achieved through greater NAR for the low plant population during the vegetative period, created by greater light interception efficiency (LIE, light interception per unit leaf area). Although NAR equilibrated to minimal levels across plant populations near R1, low population maintained CGR parity with higher populations until R5 through greater relative leaf area expansion rate (RLAER) during the late vegetative and early reproductive periods. Higher relative leaf area expansion rate for low vs. higher plant populations resulted from increased partitioning of dry matter into branches, probably induced by greater red/far red light ratios within the canopy. In conclusion, a possible genetic characteristic conducive to low optimal plant population is greater partitioning of dry matter into branches.},

	abstract = {In the Mediterranean region, zucchini squash (Cucurbita pepo L.) is widely grown under unheated greenhouse conditions for off-season production. Climatic conditions affecting both radiation and water use are mainly determined by the planting dates. Elucidating the relationship between the radiation and the water use with climate variables is important for the quantification of crop productivity and for improving water use efficiency (WUE) and radiation use efficiency (RUE). The influence of seasonal fluctuations (spring‚Äìsummer and summer‚Äìfall) resulting from two planting dates (28 March and 6 September) on growth, radiation and water use efficiencies was investigated in zucchini plants cultivated hydroponically in a unheated greenhouse located at Viterbo, central Italy. Plants grown in the spring‚Äìsummer season exhibited a higher maximum value of total, leaf, stem, fruit dry matter and leaf area index (971, 460, 91, 422gm‚àí2 and 5.1, respectively) than those grown during the summer‚Äìfall season (672, 306, 58, 311gm‚àí2 and 2.7, respectively). The marketable fresh yield in the spring‚Äìsummer was higher than the summer‚Äìfall (6.2 versus 4.7kgm‚àí2). The canopy extinction coefficient was empirically determined as 0.72 for the light interception. The crop coefficient (Kc) during the spring‚Äìsummer period ranged from 0.10 to 1.15, while for the summer‚Äìfall season the Kc ranged from 0.12 to 0.80. Before harvest initiation, the transpiration rates, RUE and water use efficiency calculated on above dry weight basis (WUEb) were similar between growing seasons (average 0.51Lm‚àí2day‚àí1, 2.07gMJ‚àí1 and 2.92gkg‚àí1, respectively), while after harvest initiation, summer‚Äìfall season showed a lower transpiration rate (0.97 versus 2.60Lm‚àí2day‚àí1) and a higher RUE (4.17 versus 2.46gMJ‚àí1) and WUEb (4.02 versus 2.73gkg‚àí1) in comparison to the spring‚Äìsummer season. Water use efficiency on fresh fruit yield basis (WUEy) was also higher in summer‚Äìfall season compared to spring‚Äìsummer season (50.5 versus 31.5gkg‚àí1). The variability in RUE and WUEb was associated with, daily mean solar radiation (Rs), daily mean air temperature (Ta) and daily mean vapour pressure deficit (VPD). In both growing phases, negative exponential relationships were evident by plotting the RUE, and WUEb against climatic variables (Rs, Ta and VPD). Rs, Ta and VPD were greatly higher in the spring‚Äìsummer season, which influences RUE and WUEb negatively. These results may be applied in greenhouse climate control and management decisions. In our case the use of light selective and movable screen may improve substantially water use efficiency of warm season crops in Mediterranean areas, where water supplies are limited.},

Percent solar radiation interception was measured periodically and was used to calculate total radiation intercepted by the crop. Sequential dry matter production was estimated by collecting above-ground plant samples. Radiation use efficiency (RUE) was calculated as the slope of the relationship between cumulative biomass and cumulative intercepted PAR. Radiation use efficiency varied between 2.27 and 2.96 g of dry weight per MJ of intercepted PAR. These values did not decline after anthesis and were lower than those reported in the literature for warmer regions.

	abstract = {Globally, 800 million people are malnourished. Heavily subsidised farmers in rich countries produce sufficient surplus food to feed the hungry, but not at a price the poor can afford. Even donating the rich world's surplus to the poor would not solve the problem. Most poor people earn their living from agriculture, so a deluge of free food would destroy their livelihoods. Thus, the only answer to world hunger is to safeguard and improve the productivity of farmers in poor countries. Diets of subsistence level farmers in Africa and Latin America often contain sufficient carbohydrates (through cassava, corn/maize, rice, wheat, etc.), but are poor in proteins. Dietary proteins can take the form of scarce animal products (eggs, milk, meat, etc.), but are usually derived from legumes (plants of the bean and pea family). Legumes are vital in agriculture as they form associations with bacteria that `fix-nitrogen' from the air. Effectively this amounts to internal fertilisation and is the main reason that legumes are richer in proteins than all other plants. Thousands of legume species exist but more common beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) are eaten than any other. In some countries such as Mexico and Brazil, beans are the primary source of protein in human diets. As half the grain legumes consumed worldwide are common beans, they represent the species of choice for the study of grain legume nutrition. Unfortunately, the yields of common beans are low even by the standards of legumes, and the quality of their seed proteins is sub-optimal. Most probably this results from millennia of selection for stable rather than high yield, and as such, is a problem that can be redressed by modern genetic techniques. We have formed an international consortium called `Phaseomics' to establish the necessary framework of knowledge and materials that will result in disease-resistant, stress-tolerant, high-quality protein and high-yielding beans. Phaseomics will be instrumental in improving living conditions in deprived regions of Africa and the Americas. It will contribute to social equity and sustainable development and enhance inter- and intra-cultural understanding, knowledge and relationships. A major goal of Phaseomics is to generate new common bean varieties that are not only suitable for but also desired by the local farmer and consumer communities. Therefore, the socio-economic dimension of improved bean production and the analysis of factors influencing the acceptance of novel varieties will be an integral part of the proposed research (see Figure 1). Here, we give an overview of the economic and nutritional importance of common beans as a food crop. Priorities and targets of current breeding programmes are outlined, along with ongoing efforts in genomics. Recommendations for an international coordinated effort to join knowledge, facilities and expertise in a variety of scientific undertakings that will contribute to the overall goal of better beans are given. To be rapid and effective, plant breeding programmes (i.e., those that involve crossing two different `parents') rely heavily on molecular `markers'. These genetic landmarks are used to position},

Nowadays, yield safety has gained more importance because of the forecasted climatic changes. Drought and high temperature are especially considered as key stress factors with high potential impact on crop yield. Yield safety can only be improved if future breeding attempts will be based on the valuable new knowledge acquired on the processes determining plant development and its responses to stress. Plant stress responses are very complex. Interactions between plant structure, function and the environment need to be investigated at various phases of plant development at the organismal, cellular as well as molecular levels in order to obtain a full picture. The results achieved so far in this field indicate that various plant organs, in a definite hierarchy and in interaction with each other, are involved in determining crop yield under stress. Here we attempt to summarize the currently available information on cereal reproduction under drought and heat stress and to give an outlook towards potential strategies to improve yield safety in cereals.},

Warmer temperatures expected with climate change and the potential for more extreme temperature events will impact plant productivity. Pollination is one of the most sensitive phenological stages to temperature extremes across all species and during this developmental stage temperature extremes would greatly affect production. Few adaptation strategies are available to cope with temperature extremes at this developmental stage other than to select for plants which shed pollen during the cooler periods of the day or are indeterminate so flowering occurs over a longer period of the growing season. In controlled environment studies, warm temperatures increased the rate of phenological development; however, there was no effect on leaf area or vegetative biomass compared to normal temperatures. The major impact of warmer temperatures was during the reproductive stage of development and in all cases grain yield in maize was significantly reduced by as much as 80‚àí90\% from a normal temperature regime. Temperature effects are increased by water deficits and excess soil water demonstrating that understanding the interaction of temperature and water will be needed to develop more effective adaptation strategies to offset the impacts of greater temperature extreme events associated with a changing climate.},

Cucurbita plants were grown in pots with increasing concentrations of the microplastics, then plant biometry, photosynthetic parameters and ionome of treated vs. untreated samples were compared to evaluate the toxicity of each plastic. All the pollutants impaired root and, especially, shoot growth. Specific and concentration-dependant effects of the different microplastics were found, including reduction in leaf size, chlorophyll content and photosynthetic efficiency, as well as changes in the micro- and macro-elemental profile. Among all the microplastics, PVC was identified as the most toxic and PE as the less toxic material. PVC decreased the dimensions of the leaf lamina, the values of the photosynthetic performance index and the plant iron concentration to a higher extent in respect to the other treatments.

Therefore, the goal of this study was to investigate the influences of three different qualities of light on plant biomass and accumulation of chlorophylls (chl), carotenoids (car), soluble proteins and sugars, and nitrates in the leaves of lettuce (Lactuca sativa L. var. capitata). The marketable sensory characteristics (crispness, sweetness, shape, and color) of fresh plants were also evaluated. Plants were hydroponically cultured with a 16-h photoperiod at 24/20¬∞C (day/night), 75\% relative humidity, 900Œºmolmol‚àí1 CO2 level, and 210Œºmolm‚àí2s‚àí1 photon flux density under RB LED, RB and white (RBW) LED, and a fluorescent lamp (FL, as a control) inside growth chambers for 20 days (15 days after sowing). The shoot and root fresh and dry weights as well as the crispness, sweetness, and shape of the plants treated with RBW and FL were higher than those of plants treated with RB. The soluble sugar and nitrate contents in plants grown under RBW treatment were significantly higher and lower, respectively, compared to those under RB treatment. However, the chl, car, and soluble protein contents of lettuce leaves showed no significant differences among treatments. These results demonstrate that supplemental light quality can be strategically used to enhance the nutritional value and growth of lettuce plants grown under RBW LED lights. Precise management of the irradiance and wavelength may hold promise in maximizing the economic efficiency of plant production, quality, and nutrition potential of vegetables grown in controlled environments.},

In wheat/maize and wheat/soybean intercropping systems, a significant yield increase of intercropped wheat over sole wheat was observed, which resulted from positive effects of the border row and inner rows of intercropped wheat. The border row effect was due to interspecific competition for nutrients as wheat had a higher competitive ability than either maize or soybean had. There was also compensatory growth, or a recovery process, of subordinate species such as maize and soybean, offsetting the impairment of early growth of the subordinate species. Finally, both dominant and subordinate species in intercropping obtain higher yields than that in corresponding sole wheat, maize or soybean. We summarized these processes as the `competition-recovery production principle'. We observed interspecific facilitation, where maize improves iron nutrition in intercropped peanut, faba bean enhances nitrogen and phosphorus uptake by intercropped maize, and chickpea facilitates P uptake by associated wheat from phytate-P. Furthermore, intercropping reduced the nitrate content in the soil profile as intercropping uses soil nutrients more efficiently than sole cropping.},

	abstract = {Freshwater biodiversity is the over-riding conservation priority during the International Decade for Action -‚ÄòWater for Life‚Äô - 2005 to 2015. Fresh water makes up only 0.01\% of the World's water and approximately 0.8 \% of the Earth's surface, yet this tiny fraction of global water supports at least 100 000 species out of approximately 1.8 million - almost 6\% of all described species. Inland waters and freshwater biodiversity constitute a valuable natural resource, in economic, cultural, aesthetic, scientific and educational terms. Their conservation and management are critical to the interests of all humans, nations and governments. Yet this precious heritage is in crisis. Fresh waters are experiencing declines in biodiversity far greater than those in the most affected terrestrial ecosystems, and if trends in human demands for water remain unaltered and species losses continue at current rates, the opportunity to conserve much of the remaining biodiversity in fresh water will vanish before the ‚ÄòWater for Life‚Äô decade ends in 2015. Why is this so, and what is being done about it? This article explores the special features of freshwater habitats and the biodiversity they support that makes them especially vulnerable to human activities. We document threats to global freshwater biodiversity under five headings: overexploitation; water pollution; flow modification; destruction or degradation of habitat; and invasion by exotic species. Their combined and interacting influences have resulted in population declines and range reduction of freshwater biodiversity worldwide. Conservation of biodiversity is complicated by the landscape position of rivers and wetlands as ‚Äòreceivers‚Äô of land-use effluents, and the problems posed by endemism and thus non-substitutability. In addition, in many parts of the world, fresh water is subject to severe competition among multiple human stakeholders. Protection of freshwater biodiversity is perhaps the ultimate conservation challenge because it is influenced by the upstream drainage network, the surrounding land, the riparian zone, and - in the case of migrating aquatic fauna - downstream reaches. Such prerequisites are hardly ever met. Immediate action is needed where opportunities exist to set aside intact lake and river ecosystems within large protected areas. For most of the global land surface, trade-offs between conservation of freshwater biodiversity and human use of ecosystem goods and services are necessary. We advocate continuing attempts to check species loss but, in many situations, urge adoption of a compromise position of management for biodiversity conservation, ecosystem functioning and resilience, and human livelihoods in order to provide a viable long-term basis for freshwater conservation. Recognition of this need will require adoption of a new paradigm for biodiversity protection and freshwater ecosystem management - one that has been appropriately termed ‚Äòreconciliation ecology‚Äô.},

	abstract = {Land use has generally been considered a local environmental issue, but it is becoming a force of global importance. Worldwide changes to forests, farmlands, waterways, and air are being driven by the need to provide food, fiber, water, and shelter to more than six billion people. Global croplands, pastures, plantations, and urban areas have expanded in recent decades, accompanied by large increases in energy, water, and fertilizer consumption, along with considerable losses of biodiversity. Such changes in land use have enabled humans to appropriate an increasing share of the planet's resources, but they also potentially undermine the capacity of ecosystems to sustain food production, maintain freshwater and forest resources, regulate climate and air quality, and ameliorate infectious diseases. We face the challenge of managing trade-offs between immediate human needs and maintaining the capacity of the biosphere to provide goods and services in the long term.},

	abstract = {In order to better assess the role of agriculture within the global climate-vegetation system, we present a model of the managed planetary land surface, Lund‚ÄìPotsdam‚ÄìJena managed Land (LPJmL), which simulates biophysical and biogeochemical processes as well as productivity and yield of the most important crops worldwide, using a concept of crop functional types (CFTs). Based on the LPJ-Dynamic Global Vegetation Model, LPJmL simulates the transient changes in carbon and water cycles due to land use, the specific phenology and seasonal CO2 fluxes of agricultural-dominated areas, and the production of crops and grazing land. It uses 13 CFTs (11 arable crops and two managed grass types), with specific parameterizations of phenology connected to leaf area development. Carbon is allocated daily towards four carbon pools, one being the yield-bearing storage organs. Management (irrigation, treatment of residues, intercropping) can be considered in order to capture their effect on productivity, on soil organic carbon and on carbon extracted from the ecosystem. For transient simulations for the 20th century, a global historical land use data set was developed, providing the annual cover fraction of the 13 CFTs, rain-fed and/or irrigated, within 0.5¬∞ grid cells for the period 1901‚Äì2000, using published data on land use, crop distributions and irrigated areas. Several key results are compared with observations. The simulated spatial distribution of sowing dates for temperate cereals is comparable with the reported crop calendars. The simulated seasonal canopy development agrees better with satellite observations when actual cropland distribution is taken into account. Simulated yields for temperate cereals and maize compare well with FAO statistics. Monthly carbon fluxes measured at three agricultural sites also compare well with simulations. Global simulations indicate a ‚àº24\% (respectively ‚àº10\%) reduction in global vegetation (respectively soil) carbon due to agriculture, and 6‚Äì9 Pg C of yearly harvested biomass in the 1990s. In contrast to simulations of the potential natural vegetation showing the land biosphere to be an increasing carbon sink during the 20th century, LPJmL simulates a net carbon source until the 1970s (due to land use), and a small sink (mostly due to changing climate and CO2) after 1970. This is comparable with earlier LPJ simulations using a more simple land use scheme, and within the uncertainty range of estimates in the 1980s and 1990s. The fluxes attributed to land use change compare well with Houghton's estimates on the land use related fluxes until the 1970s, but then they begin to diverge, probably due to the different rates of deforestation considered. The simulated impacts of agriculture on the global water cycle for the 1990s are‚àº5\% (respectively‚àº20\%) reduction in transpiration (respectively interception), and‚àº44\% increase in evaporation. Global runoff, which includes a simple irrigation scheme, is practically not affected.},

	abstract = {Intercropping is a farming practice involving two or more crop species, or genotypes, growing together and coexisting for a time. On the fringes of modern intensive agriculture, intercropping is important in many subsistence or low-input/resource-limited agricultural systems. By allowing genuine yield gains without increased inputs, or greater stability of yield with decreased inputs, intercropping could be one route to delivering ‚Äòsustainable intensification‚Äô. We discuss how recent knowledge from agronomy, plant physiology and ecology can be combined with the aim of improving intercropping systems. Recent advances in agronomy and plant physiology include better understanding of the mechanisms of interactions between crop genotypes and species ‚Äì for example, enhanced resource availability through niche complementarity. Ecological advances include better understanding of the context-dependency of interactions, the mechanisms behind disease and pest avoidance, the links between above- and below-ground systems, and the role of microtopographic variation in coexistence. This improved understanding can guide approaches for improving intercropping systems, including breeding crops for intercropping. Although such advances can help to improve intercropping systems, we suggest that other topics also need addressing. These include better assessment of the wider benefits of intercropping in terms of multiple ecosystem services, collaboration with agricultural engineering, and more effective interdisciplinary research.},

	abstract = {Abstract Plant responses to salt and water stress have much in common. Salinity reduces the ability of plants to take up water, and this quickly causes reductions in growth rate, along with a suite of metabolic changes identical to those caused by water stress. The initial reduction in shoot growth is probably due to hormonal signals generated by the roots. There may be salt-specific effects that later have an impact on growth; if excessive amounts of salt enter the plant, salt will eventually rise to toxic levels in the older transpiring leaves, causing premature senescence, and reduce the photosynthetic leaf area of the plant to a level that cannot sustain growth. These effects take time to develop. Salt-tolerant plants differ from salt-sensitive ones in having a low rate of Na+ and Cl‚Äì transport to leaves, and the ability to compartmentalize these ions in vacuoles to prevent their build-up in cytoplasm or cell walls and thus avoid salt toxicity. In order to understand the processes that give rise to tolerance of salt, as distinct from tolerance of osmotic stress, and to identify genes that control the transport of salt across membranes, it is important to avoid treatments that induce cell plasmolysis, and to design experiments that distinguish between tolerance of salt and tolerance of water stress.},
